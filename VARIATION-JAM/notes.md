start screen, animation wind hair & clouds moving, options for the 3 games
game one: catch as many wild sheeps as possible! if you win, option to go to the next game *big shiny* or go back to start screen
game two: wash and clean one sheep, the many years later screen, whole troupeau is done -> you win, option to go to the next game *big shiny* or go back to start screen
game three: protect from the wolves -> you can only die and get to the end screen
end screen: oh no! you lost all your sheeps! well better start catching some new one -> goes to the start screen where you can select all the games

1. sheep are trying to avoid the mouse, you try to push them inside the fence, if you get more than half you win, can pass to the second game, if not try again (option to go back to start screen too if it's too frustrating)
2. one dirty sheep in the middle of a stable, on the side is food and wash stuff, click and drag to sheep to make it happy (idk how to declare a winner tho?)
3. flock of sheep in the middle of the screen, wolves are coming from both sides and you need to click and drag them bag, if they get close they start eating the sheep, you have to last like 1 min.
end screen: win the last game = congrats! you are a masterful sheepkeeper, this is your sign to run away in the pasture
lose the last game = oh no! you lost all your sheeps! well better start catching some new ones! back to the start screen for the first game


1. conditional challenge, if the asset moves x, y, change the sprite
