## Description

This description should help the reader understand what the program is, anything they should know to be able to experience it (controls, special features, etc.), and what the desired user experience is. For example:

> *Starlight* Is my self-portrait project, the base of it is a little guy that looks like me with lots of blue tone, which is my favorite color. There is also a star and glow effect because I like the feeling behind the super famous quote "The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff" from Carl Sagan. 

> The Star *supposed to - IT WORKS REJOICE!* spins in the center of my face and hides my eyes.

> The glow effect gets stronger and more opaque the closer our mouse is to the center.

> 

## Screenshot(s)
