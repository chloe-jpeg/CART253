## Description

> *Starlight* Is my self-portrait project, the base of it is a little guy that looks like me with lots of blue tone, which is my favorite color. There is also a star and glow effect because I like the feeling behind the super famous quote "The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff" from Carl Sagan. And sea because i love the beach.

> The Star spins in the center of my face and hides my eyes.

> The glow effect gets stronger and more opaque the closer our mouse is to the center.

> When you click the mouse, a song starts. Click it again and it stops.

## Screenshot(s)
