20 ideas for frogfrogfrog
1. the background changes color, gradient night/day (a loop that goes from light blue to dark blue)
2. we have a moon/sun that moves in the sky (this one i'm fairly certain i could to it quickly, all the botched rotation attempt from my star last project got me the effect i'd want)
3. score board (rectangles, my vision is rounded corners)
4. confetties everytime you have +10 or other ( to celebrate your victory, don't know how i would do the actual confetties, but it could be triggered by connecting to the score board)
5. what if the frog was an anteater (fairly similar principle, different mascot)
6. what if the flies were ants (to connect with the anteater)
7. what if the frog was a seagull (maybe it flies up? wing animation?)
8. what if the flies were french fries (the natural source of food in the wild for seagulls)
9. staying alive is playing in the background, and everytime the frog eats a fly it starts again (rage edition, maybe you lose if too many flies are let go to make sure people play the game)
10. what if the flies were coded to avoid the tongue, like swerving at the last minute (rage edition part 2, if the tongue gets close, move or something)
11. the frog could jump/the body could go higher if the flies are super high (double jump action, get the space bar involved)
12. the body doesn't move, but the tongue follows the mouse (less of a clicking game, more mousseMoved)
13. there are clouds moving from left to right (add a bit of variation in the background)
14. there's plants in the foreground (also adds a bit more to it)
15. it's a Gray Treefrog and everytime you have +25 pts, it changes color (gray, green, brown + orange and yellow patches, also connected to the score)
16. different insects that also have different points, like fly=1, beetle=2, spider+3...ect (common treefrog food, would need to connect what insect means what points)
17. you can start as a tadpole (eat algae) and after a certain amount of points you become a frog (but that would be 2 different games, for this one i was thinking more of a slither.oi type game)
18. there's some frog noises and general forest sounds (pretty easy, just have a loop)
19. there's water at the bottom of the screen and the frog is just chilling (like the plants and the clouds, just add a bit of bg element, maybe transparency to show the frog)
20. the frog is underwater when there aren't any insects to eat and goes to the usual height when playing (if there is no action (no key pressed, no mousse clicked) then the frog goes completely underwater, when playing it goes to usual height)
