## Description

BOG EATER is a game where you, a frog, is very very hungry. 

> Press spacebar to start the game, click the mouse to launch your tongue and try to cath as many flies as possible to satiate your hunger. 

> Your body follows the mouse, and if you miss too many flies you will starve to death and become part of the bog's ecosystem.

> If you wish to test your skills again, Ctrl+R to restart the game.

> This game is meant to give the understanding of eat or be eaten and the brutal battle of survival in the wild.
