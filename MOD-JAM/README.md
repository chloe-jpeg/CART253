## Description

BOG EATER is a game where you, a frog, is very very hungry. 

> Press spacebar to start the game, click the mouse to launch your tongue and try to catch as many flies as possible to satiate your hunger. Watch out, they can come from both side of the screen.

> Your body follows the mouse, and if you miss too many flies you will starve to death and become part of the bog's ecosystem.

> If you wish to test your skills again, Ctrl+R to restart the game.

> This game is meant to give the understanding of eat or be eaten and the brutal battle of survival in the wild.
