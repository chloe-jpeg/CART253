When I Look In The Mirror - Benjamin Mehri

When I first looked at the Mirror assignment, I thought the style was really cool, the lines were so clean and it kind of made me think of a minecraft persona. I had to read the READ.ME document to learn about the secret test, which I guess I failed because I immediately started playing with the head. The cartoonish bone was such a nice touch, it really ties in well with the rest of the style. I was super impressed with how Benjamin managed to keep the whole head together when moving it up and down, I can't even guess how long it would take me to figure that one out. The background changing color is also a fun bonus, to really point out the atrocity that we are committing. Overall a project that looks very clean and put together.

Me Doing This Assignment - Alexandre Chardon

For this assignment, the style is also really cartoonish but in a different way, I feel like this could be easily found as a small computer game on Friv or something, I keep expecting to start solving little puzzles. The attention to details is also really well done, the eye bags and the mouse in particular are tiny but well made. The whole canvas is used, with something to catch our attention everywhere, which I thought was nice. Something that I really liked was the music box used to play the sounds, it's such a cool idea and to keep the start and stop to the actual play/stop button is such a nice touch and the code seems so simple. The moveCreature is also really well done, it moves smoothly and doesn't look to have any bugs, it also stays in one unit, very fun to play around with just on the side of the screen.

jam art - Dyna Benaziza

I was pleasantly surprised when I opened Dyna's project, it's so unique and creative, it was not something I was expecting to see but she does it really well. The colors look great together and the fullness of it makes everything flow well. The background with different squares is really interesting, and the fact that everything has a black outline helps separate them from each other. All the colors have a similar saturation except the pupil of the eyes which makes them pop. I liked the fact that you can move around one eye and the spiral to make a new portrait, and it was a fun surprise when moving the first one and then clicking around trying to find what else can be moved. The spiral is very clean, and on the code/READ.ME Dyna said it was an element she had never done before, but it was well executed and it kept its good shape even while moving it is pretty impressive.
